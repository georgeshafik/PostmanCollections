# Postman Collections

This repo contains full postman collections for most of the MM APIs. This will be added to over time.

## Instructions

You can use these by cloning the repo and importing into your Postman Application OR with the buttons below.

First sign up for a developer key and receive your starter credit at:

https://developers.messagemedia.com/register/

Be sure to keep this somewhere safe after you register. 

Click on the collection you want to use below and it will open up in Postman. In the side draw for postman hover over the top level of the collection that jsut imported until you see the three dots. Click on the three dots menu, and select edit, to select the collection level details.  

![step1](/img/topleveledit1.png)

Go to the variables tab and make sure the username and password variables are present and have been updated to be your username (developer key) and password (developer secret). 

![step2](/img/usernamepasswordedit.png)

Go to the authorisation tab and check that the authorisation type is set to Basic Auth and the username and password reference the variables. 

![step3](/img/authorisationedit.png)

All other sublevels of the collection should have all set to "Inherit auth from parent".

You can now run the collections by changing the relevant key value pairs. Be sure to consult the documentation for which ones are required and which ones you can delete as well as information about what each key value pair is for. 

### Lookups

The Lookups API will enable you to reduce the number of failed messages your send by looking up details about intended recipients. Validate the phone numbers youâ€™re sending to by checking their validity, type and carrier details.

In the collection update the headers with your parameters. Enter your phone number, and one or more of the lookup type. You can use "carrier, type" together or individually (seperate with a comma). Option "hlr" can only be used individually.
